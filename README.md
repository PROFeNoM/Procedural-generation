# Description

The objective of this project is to implement functionally a collection of image generators and image filters in order to make procedural generation of textures. The code is broken down into two distinct parts:
- A set of image generators
- A set of image filters

# Requirements

- The ```make``` command 
- canvas package
- jest package
- browserify package
- Standard JS libraries

# How to produce an image

Open the image.js file in the src directory. Delete all "/*...*/" comments between line 25 and 629. Choose a generator and / or filters and choose a template to compute the image. Then go to the root of the project directory and run

```shell
$ make exe
```
to produce the image as canvas.png in the project root directory

else you can run

```shell
$ make gen
```
to produce a page with the image at public/index.html

# Generators

## Noise generators

- Explication: a set of noise generator like Perlin noise or Worley noise 
- Path from root: ```./src/noiseGenerators.js```

## Tiling generators

- Explication: a set of tiling generator like chessBoard or Voronoi patterns
- Path from root: ```./src/tilingGenerators.js```

## Color gradient

- Explication: a set of color gradient
- Path from root: ```./src/colorMapGenerator.js``` or ```./src/colorMapExamples.js```

# Filters

- Explication: a set of filters like a 3d-filter, a zoom filter or even image compositions filters
- Path from root: ```./src/filter.js```

# How to run tests

At the root of the repository, run

```shell
$ make test
```

# How to clean the repository

- Go to the root of the repository

- To clean the repository to its initial state, run

```shell
$ make clean
```
